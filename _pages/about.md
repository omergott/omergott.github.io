I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Brown University working on a variety of problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Michael Littman and George Konidaris. Currently, my main area of focus is understanding the geometric structure of value functions in continuous state and action spaces, and exploiting it for improving RL algorithms. Prior to coming to Brown, I obtained my PhD from Harvard University working with Finale Doshi-Velez on Off-Policy Evaluation and applying RL algorithms to healthcare. In my even more distant past I was a physicist working on a wide range of topics including stochastic population models, exploration of exo-planets and (most esoterically) the way paper crumples.
